                        Though we are a Muslim-friendly space (providing prayer areas, serving halal food and drinks) we
                        are not a Muslim-exclusive space. Chai & Vibes is and always will be a space welcome to all
                        races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, and ages.

                        <span class="font-semibold">Community-Building</span>
                        The purpose of our space is to build community and create long-lasting friendships. Though you
                        may find networking opportunities or your soulmate along the way, our sole purpose is to ensure
                        you feel comfortable, welcomed, and encouraged to create connections with friends and strangers.

                        Chai & Vibes strives to create a platform that can serve to uplift performers, artists, and
                        vendors. We try to ensure that these individuals align with the same mission & values. We expect
                        them to respect our space and attendees, and ask that our attendees give them the love, respect,
                        and graciousness they deserve. If you are interested in collaborating with us please contact us
